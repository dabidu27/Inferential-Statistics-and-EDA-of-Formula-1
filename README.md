# Formula 1 Statistics Project

This project analyzes Formula 1 data using **inferential statistics** in R.  
It includes **confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression models** applied to race and driver data.

## üîé Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore whether Formula 1 performance is driven more by **drivers** or **teams**, using data from multiple seasons.  
We apply various statistical methods to investigate:
- Driver ages and performance  
- Circuit types (street vs permanent)  
- Influence of qualifying position on finishing position  
- Team tier effects

## üìä Statistical Analyses

### Confidence Intervals
- Estimated **average age** of Formula 1 drivers.  
- Estimated the **proportion of street circuits** on the calendar.  

### Hypothesis Testing
1. Do drivers improve their position during races?  
2. Is the **average driver age > 30**?  
3. Do drivers under 25 achieve **better than 10th place** on average?  

### ANOVA
- Differences in mean **driver age** across constructor tiers.  
- Differences in **qualifying position** across age categories.  
- Differences in **finishing position** across constructor tiers.  

### Regression Analysis
- **Simple Linear Regression**  
  - Finishing position ~ Constructor‚Äôs championship standing  
  - Finishing position ~ Driver age  
  - Finishing position ~ Circuit type  
  - Finishing position ~ Qualifying position  

- **Multiple Linear Regression**  
  - Combined effect of qualifying position, constructor performance, race type, and interactions.
